Variant Effect Predictor

Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) analysis was performed to determine the effects of SNPs and indels in both core and noncore genes

Dependecies
- HTSlib 1.9
- CentOS 7.5.26.1
- Ensembl VEP 97.3

Results    
Data on SNPs and indels for core and noncore genes were plotted on a stacked bar chart to analyse the number of mutations with differing levels of severity. The code used to generate this plot is in    
- vep_plot.py
